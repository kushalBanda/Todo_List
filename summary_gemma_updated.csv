Here's what we can gather:

* **Excipient Information:** The text refers to an excipient with a product code of ""236"" and a Batch Manufacturing Record (BMR) reference number ""KR/236"". This suggests it's part of a detailed manufacturing process for a pharmaceutical product.
* **Tabular Data:** The table lists various materials used in pharmaceuticals, likely including the excipient mentioned in the text.  

**Key information from the table:**

* Each material has a unique ""Material Code"" and ""Material Name"". 
* It also includes information about the manufacturer: their name, address, qualification status (indicating they meet quality standards), and the date of last update.

**Possible Connections:**

While we don't have enough information to definitively connect the text and table, it's highly likely that ""236"" in the text corresponds to one of the ""Material Code"" entries in the table. The next step would be to cross-reference the codes to determine which specific material is being referred to as the excipient.

The review covers the period from May 13, 2021, to December 31, 2024. It highlights an Out-of-Specification (OOS) result due to unknown peaks appearing in the initial chromatogram analysis.

To address this issue, the initial chromatogram was reprocessed using phase-1A analysis. This resulted in subject and impacted batches falling within specification limits.  Therefore, the phase-IA analysis results were considered for final reporting. 

The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of caution while preparing processing methods for sample sets, recommending adherence to SOP028165 for HPLC and UPLC operation practices.

The review focuses on addressing an Out-of-Specification (OOS) result encountered during initial analysis.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Issue:** An analyst mistakenly labeled blank peaks in the chromatogram as unknown peaks, leading to OOS results for some batches.
* **Resolution:** The initial chromatography was reprocessed under Phase-1A analysis. Results for subject and impacted batches were found within specification limits. 
* **Conclusion:** The OOS result was attributed to processing error. Reprocessing with the correct parameters resolved the issue, and there is no impact on product quality.

**Recommendations:**

The document also includes recommendations to prevent similar issues in the future:

1.  **Careful Verification:** Verify each chromatogram individually using appropriate processing methods before finalizing results.
2. **Increased Vigilance:** Exercise caution and attentiveness when developing processing methods for sample integration. Ensure all parameters adhere to SOP028165 (HPLC and UPLC operation practices).

The review period spans from February 8th, 2022 to August 25th, 2023. It follows a standard operating procedure (SOP XXXX) but the specific SOP number is redacted.

The table displays quality data for several batches of the product (identified by codes like 7237560). For each batch, two key quality attributes are reported:

* **Unnamed Column:** Likely represents assay or purity percentage
* **Unnamed Column:**  Possibly a measure of another quality parameter, such as particle size or dissolution rate

The table also includes statistical summaries (MIN, AVG, MAX) and specification limits (LSL, USL) for these attributes.


**Key Observations:**

* All batches fall within the specified ranges for both quality attributes.
* The average assay/purity is consistently high, above 99%.
* The second attribute shows more variability but remains within acceptable limits.","E:/APQR LLM/Data/mapped/page89table1/page_89_table_1.csv"""

Here's what we can gather:

**Text Snippet:**

* This snippet likely relates to a specific OOT event, indicated by ""Out of Trends"" and a Product Code (236).
* The BMR Ref No (KR/236) suggests an associated Batch Manufacturing Record.
* A score of 7.3 is mentioned but its context is unclear without further information.

**Table Snippet:**

* This table summarizes OOT investigations. Each row represents a separate OOT event.

* **Columns:**
    * **Sr.No.:** Sequential number for each OOT investigation.
    * **OOT.No.:** Unique identifier for the OOT event. 
    * **OOT Related to:**  Type of analysis related to the OOT (e.g., Utilities Analytical, Product Analytical).
    * **OOT Type:** Classification of the OOT (not clear from the snippet what types exist).
    * **Batch Reference No.:** Identifier for the specific batch involved in the OOT.
    * **OOT Description:** Detailed explanation of the OOT event and findings.
    * **Root Cause:** Identified reason for the OOT.
    * **Ref CAPA:**  Reference to a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) implemented to address the root cause.
    * **Investigational Outcome (Root Cause):** Confirmation of the identified root cause.
    * **Impact Assessment:** Evaluation of the potential consequences of the OOT.
    * **CAPA Details:** Specific actions taken as part of the CAPA.

* The example row shows an OOT related to Product Analytical testing, with a ""Highest Unknown impurity"" detected.  The investigation identified a laboratory error in chromatogram processing. The CAPA details include recommendations for improved sample verification and attention to detail during analysis.



**Overall Summary:**

The information suggests a quality control process where OOT events are investigated systematically.  Root causes are determined, and CAPAs are implemented to prevent recurrence.

The table presents statistical quality control data:
* **Cp:** This is the process capability index, measuring the spread of the process relative to the specification limits. A value of 1.856549 indicates that the process is capable.
* **Cp_l & Cp_u:** These are lower and upper process capability indices, reflecting how well the process meets the lower and upper specifications respectively. Values of 3.285720 (lower) and 0.427378 (upper) suggest potential issues with meeting the lower specification.
* **Cp_k:** This is a combined process capability index considering both lower and upper specifications. A value of 0.427378 suggests that the process may not be consistently meeting both specifications.
* **Cpm:** This index measures the closeness of the process average to the target value, with a lower value (0.215049) suggesting potential deviations from the desired target.

Overall, while the process shows some capability (Cp > 1), there are concerns regarding its ability to consistently meet both upper and lower specification limits (Cp_l & Cp_u, Cp_k). Further investigation is recommended to identify potential sources of variation and improve process control.","E:/APQR LLM/Data/mapped/page107table1/page_107_table_1.csv"""

* **SubStage1:** Temperature Maintenance
* **SubStage2:** Reflux Temperature


The table data appears to be related to a quality control check for a process step labeled ""Process Step-I"".  

Here's what we can glean from the table:

* **Batch Numbers:** The table lists various batch numbers, suggesting different production runs.
* **Blower Speed:** This is listed as a parameter but lacks values except for a descriptive instruction to ""Maintain the temperature upto 25 degree - NA"" (likely meaning ""Not Applicable"").
* **Compliance:** The table indicates whether each batch number ""complies"" with the process requirement for ""Process Step-I"". Most batches show compliance, while some have missing data (NaN).

**Connecting the Information:**


It's likely that ""Process Step-I"" involves controlling temperature using blower speed, as suggested by the text mentioning ""Temperature Maintenance"" and the table's description. The table data shows which batches successfully maintained the required temperature.

However, without further context on what ""Process Step-I"" entails, it's difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the relationship between the text and the table.","E:/APQR LLM/Data/mapped/page10table2/page_10_table_2.csv"""

The table data shows quality control results for individual Kratom batches:

* **Product Code:** All entries share the same product code (236), indicating they are all Kratom.
* **Batch ID:** Each row represents a unique batch of Kratom identified by codes like AZ827833, DF365243, etc.
* **Date:** The ""Date"" column shows when the quality control check was performed for each batch. Dates range from February 2, 2022, to January 25, 2023.

**Key Observations:**

* All batches listed were ""Approved,"" suggesting they met quality standards.
* **Potency Values:** The table includes potency values (likely measured as a percentage), ranging from 24.80 to 25.90.  This indicates variations in the concentration of active compounds within different Kratom batches.
* **Rework:** Some batches (like DF365243 and PVB76454) are marked as ""Regular"" or ""Rework."" This could imply that some batches required additional processing before meeting quality specifications.

**Missing Information:**


The document lacks key information for a complete understanding:

* **Site:** The manufacturing site for these Kratom batches is not specified.
* **Specifications:**  What are the acceptable potency ranges for Kratom? Without this context, it's hard to assess if the observed variations are significant.
* **Reason for Rework:**  Why were certain batches classified as ""Rework""? Understanding the cause of rework would provide valuable insights into potential production issues.

However, based on the tabular data, it appears to show:

* **Batch Numbers:**  Unique identifiers for different batches (e.g., YU89373, YT763543).

* **Load Quantity:** Two columns likely represent the maximum and minimum acceptable load quantities for each batch, expressed as percentages.

* **Ranges:** The text mentions a ""Min And Max Range"" of 20-70%, suggesting that the load quantity for each batch should fall within this range.

**Summary:**

The table presents data on multiple batches, specifying the maximum and minimum allowable load quantities for each batch.  All batches seem to have a target load quantity range of 20% to 70%.



To provide a more insightful summary, I need more context about what this data represents. For example:

* What is being loaded?
* What is the purpose of these batches?
* Are there any other relevant factors influencing the load quantities?","E:/APQR LLM/Data/mapped/page28table2/page_28_table_2.csv"""

**The Issue:** Initial analysis identified unknown peaks in chromatograms, leading to OOS results.  Further investigation revealed a processing error by the analyst who mistakenly labeled blank peaks as unknown impurities.

**Resolution:**

* The initial chromatograms were reprocessed under phase-1A analysis, and results for subject and impacted batches were found within specifications.
* An OOS history review of the past 12 months showed no similar errors by the same analyst.
* Awareness training was provided to the concerned analyst and their team emphasizing careful verification of chromatograms and attention to detail while creating processing methods.

**Outcome:** The error was classified as an isolated incident, likely due to human error. Retesting and retraining addressed the issue, ensuring future analyses are accurate.

The table details a specific market complaint (MC/KR), related to packaging (KR/PCK2) and batch number FG92653 & KL99386. The issue stemmed from a laboratory processing error during chromatography analysis, leading to Out-of-Specification (OOS) results.

A corrective action preventive action (CAPA) plan was implemented (CAPA/01). This involved reprocessing the initial chromatography under phase-1A analysis. Subsequent results for subject and impacted batches were within specifications, allowing for final reporting. 


The CAPA also emphasized the importance of careful verification of individual sample chromatograms using appropriate processing methods to prevent future errors.","E:/APQR LLM/Data/mapped/page55table1/page_55_table_1.csv"""

* **Version:** 9.2
* **Product Code:** 236
* **BMR Ref No:** KR/236


The table presents data on the qualification status of various utilities:

*  Each row represents a different utility (identified by ""Utility ID"").
* The table shows information about the ""Type of Process"" each utility is used for (e.g., ""Environment"", ""Nitrogen Gas"") and its ""Purpose"". 
* Importantly, it also indicates the ""Qualification Status"" of each utility, which can be either ""Qualified"" or ""Not Qualified"".

**Possible Connections:**

While there's no direct link between the text header and the table data provided, we can infer:

* The document likely details qualification records for various utilities.
*  The product code (236) and BMR reference number (KR/236) could be associated with a specific utility mentioned in the table.

The table presents data from 18 batches, each identified by a Batch No. Key parameters assessed for each batch include:

* **Physical Appearance:** All batches ""complied"" with the required physical appearance standard.
* **Uniformity of Dosage Unit:** This is measured through the weight of 20 filled capsules, with minimum (Min), maximum (Max) and average values recorded for each batch. The table also shows the Lower Specification Limit (LSL), Minimum (MIN), Average (AVG), Maximum (MAX), and Upper Specification Limit (USL).

**Summary Observations:**

* All batches passed the visual inspection for physical appearance.
* There is variability in the uniformity of dosage units across the batches, with weights ranging from 0.70 to 6.80 grams.
* The average weight falls within the acceptable range (AVG: 1.79).

Here's a breakdown:

* **overallStdDev (0.778649):** This likely represents the overall standard deviation of the dataset. A higher value indicates greater variability in the data.
* **Pp (0.321069):**  Pp is a process capability index that measures the potential performance of a process. It compares the spread of the process data to the specification width. A higher Pp value suggests better process capability. 
* **Ppk (0.256427):** Ppk is another process capability index, but it considers both the process spread and its centering relative to the target value.  A lower Ppk than Pp indicates that the process might be off-center, leading to a higher chance of producing defective outputs.


**In Conclusion:**

The table suggests a process with moderate variability (overallStdDev). While the potential capability (Pp) is decent, the actual capability (Ppk) is lower, implying that the process may not be perfectly centered on the target, potentially resulting in some outputs falling outside acceptable limits.

The table presents microbiological test results for this material. It shows the counts of:

* **Total bacterial count**: Measured in colony-forming units per gram (cfu/g)
* **Yeast and moulds**: Also measured in cfu/g

The table includes individual measurements for these parameters, with some values exceeding the ""Not More Than"" (NMT) limits specified. For example, several total bacterial counts are above 100 cfu/g and yeast & mould counts exceed 50 cfu/g. Notably, there are some missing data points (""NaN"") suggesting incomplete testing for certain samples.

**Key Takeaways:**

* The material is being tested for microbial contamination (bacteria, yeasts, and moulds).
* Some test results exceed the predefined acceptance limits.
* Incomplete data may necessitate further investigation or retesting.



To provide a more comprehensive summary, we would need additional context:

* What is the specific ""Material"" being tested? 
* What are the intended uses of this material?
* Are there any established acceptance criteria for these microbial counts?","E:/APQR LLM/Data/mapped/page73table2/page_73_table_2.csv"""

Here are the key takeaways:

* **Production:** A total of 20 batches of PEG in various weights (17g, 119g, 238g, 510g, and 850g) were manufactured.  
* **Specific Weight Batches:** Notably, 20 batches were produced specifically for the 17g weight, while only 5 batches were manufactured for the 510g weight.

* **Quality & Compliance:** The report indicates zero occurrences of several quality and compliance issues:
    * Out-of-trend data points
    * Change requests
    * Complaints
    * Returned goods
    * Recalls
    * Deviations
    * Out-of-specification results
    * Re-processed batches
    * Rejected batches
    * CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) initiations 

* **Regulatory Inspection:** One regulatory inspection was conducted.
